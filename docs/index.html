      <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT </h3>
      <p>The main meteorological characteristics that need to be continuously watched are the
        day-to-day variations of weather variables including rainfall, temperature, wind speed, and
        humidity. At regular intervals, the meteorological satellites offer a synoptic measurement of
        weather characteristics. Weather forecasting now heavily relies on satellite photos of cloud
        cover and other variables like winds, rainfall, sea surface temperature, etc.</p>
        <p>The India Meteorological Department in India does not promptly offer enough
            information (IMD). Radio and television are the only available media for disseminating
            information about impending natural disasters. Although there have been significant
            improvements in information delivery, it is not current. Quality of observational data,
            timeliness, availability, and, most crucially, the type and dependability of the communication
            technologies available for prediction distribution are all issues with</p>

    <h3>PROPOSED SOLUTION</h3>
    <p>A weather app that leverages augmented reality to deliver visual data is therefore
        required (AR). A weather app allows users to track current weather conditions in real-time and
        make forecasts for the given location. In order to enhance user experience and provide better
        visualization utilizing augmented reality (AR), we are developing a weather app.</p>
